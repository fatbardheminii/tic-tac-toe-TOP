# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple web-based game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. 
This project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with options for playing against another player or against the computer.
This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum.

- Choose your mark (X or O) for Player One.
- Enter custom names for Player One and Player Two.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Bug Notice
**Bug:** When playing against the computer, on even-numbered rounds, the computer should make the first move. However, this functionality is currently not working. 
To overcome this issue, manually make the first move for the computer, then proceed with the first move for Player One, and then the computer will be active again.
